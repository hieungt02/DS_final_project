How to Run Instructions:

1. Connect to the student cluster 
2. Transfer folder with all files in zip and cd into the folder 
3. Inside the folder, run the following command: g++ -std=c++11 -Wall *.cpp
4. Once the command has finished compiling, run the following to check the outputs of the program: ./a.out -s
